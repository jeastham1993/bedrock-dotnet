# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs, suggest features, or documentation improvements.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the **main** branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an [issue](https://github.com/jeastham1993/aws-lambda-dotnet-handler-cookbook/issues) before you begin any implementation. We value your time and bandwidth. As such, any pull requests created on non-triaged issues might not be successful.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
